This repository demonstrates a common issue in CSS where using relative paths for background images can lead to unexpected behavior. The `bug.css` file contains the incorrect path, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.  The problem occurs when the image file is not in the same directory as the CSS file. The solution involves using a correct relative path or an absolute path to specify the image location.
